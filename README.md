## Android 8.0
## arm64
## LinuxKernelVersion: 3.10.73
## KernelSourceCode: 
https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/+/refs/heads/android-msm-angler-3.10-oreo-m2

this version of the kernel address does not change randomly 

I have to recompile the kernel with the option CONFIG_MODULES turned on
